## Who am I? üìù
I'm just a 26 years-old girl who is moving from commercial area to development

## What do I do?
Nowadays I work for SIGCORP as Technical Inside Sales, I am doing the Bootcamp FullStack Developer of RocketSeat and I am also studing Java at Mentorama.

## Which tools am I learning and using? :construction_worker:
- Java (my priority!)
- Spring
- Javascript
- Node.JS


## What I want to do? üöÄ
I am studing to be a **Back-End Developer** so that I'm learning more about fullstack with [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/ "RocketSeat") and back-end with [Mentorama](https://mentorama.co/).

I am studying both, because Java and Javascript have a conection when we talk about web development, so I do not have any problem about to study and to comphrend both at the same time. Actually, since I have started to study Java together Javascript, I have understood so much more about and how programmig.
